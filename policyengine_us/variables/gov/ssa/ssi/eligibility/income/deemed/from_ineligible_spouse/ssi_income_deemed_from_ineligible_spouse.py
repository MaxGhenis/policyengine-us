    Calculates the amount of income deemed from an ineligible spouse to an SSI-eligible individual.
    
    Follows the process specified in 20 CFR §416.1163:
    1. Determine ineligible spouse's income (§416.1163(a))
    2. Apply allocations for ineligible children from spouse's income (§416.1163(b))
    3. Determine if remaining income exceeds the FBR differential (§416.1163(d))
    4. If it exceeds the threshold, combine incomes and apply exclusions (§416.1163(d)(2))
    5. Calculate deemed amount based on the difference between combined and individual incomes
    
    This implementation specifically addresses the regulations in §416.1163(d) regarding
    the comparison to the Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) differential.
