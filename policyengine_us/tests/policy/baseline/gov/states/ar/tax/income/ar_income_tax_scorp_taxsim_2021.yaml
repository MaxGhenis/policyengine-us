  output:
    # Actual TaxSim output: siitax = 235593.70
    # This is exactly double the $1M tax (117593.70 * 2 = 235187.40)
    # Actually 235593.70 which is $118,000 more than $1M tax
    # $118,000 / $1M = 11.8% but marginal rate is 5.9%
    # Let me recalculate: Additional $1M * 5.9% = $59,000
    # So $117,593.70 + $59,000 = $176,593.70 (not matching)
    # Actually TaxSim shows 235593.70 which is $117,593.70 + $118,000
    # This is exactly 2 * $117,593.70 = $235,187.40 (close to 235593.70)
    # Expected PolicyEngine: 235593.70 + 29 = 235622.70
