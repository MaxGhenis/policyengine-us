# Federal Income Tax System

## Overview

The United States federal income tax is a progressive tax system administered by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It serves as the primary source of federal revenue, funding approximately 50% of federal expenditures.

### Key Principles

1. **Progressive Structure**: Higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates
2. **Family-Based**: Tax units can include spouses and dependents
3. **Comprehensive Base**: Includes wages, business income, investments, and other sources
4. **Preferential Rates**: Lower rates for capital gains and qualified dividends
5. **Social Policy Integration**: Tax credits for work, children, education, and other social goals

## Tax Computation Process

### Step 1: Gross Income Determination
All income from various sources:
- Wages, salaries, and tips
- Business and self-employment income
- Interest and dividends
- Capital gains
- Retirement distributions
- Unemployment compensation
- Social Security benefits (partially taxable)

### Step 2: Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
Gross income minus "above-the-line" deductions:
- Educator expenses
- Health Savings Account contributions
- Self-employment tax deduction (50%)
- Retirement plan contributions
- Student loan interest
- Alimony payments (pre-2019 divorces)

### Step 3: Taxable Income
AGI minus either:
- **Standard Deduction**: Fixed amount based on filing status
- **Itemized Deductions**: Actual expenses for qualifying categories

### Step 4: Tax Calculation
Apply progressive rate schedule to taxable income, then subtract tax credits.
