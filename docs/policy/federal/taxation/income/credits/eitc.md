# Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)

## Overview

The Earned Income Tax Credit is the largest federal anti-poverty program for working families, providing over $60 billion annually to approximately 25 million households. It is a refundable tax credit designed to supplement wages for low-to-moderate income workers, particularly those with children.

### Policy Objectives

1. **Work Incentive**: Encourages labor force participation through phase-in structure
2. **Poverty Reduction**: Lifts approximately 5.6 million people out of poverty annually
3. **Income Supplementation**: Can increase annual income by up to 45% for qualifying families
4. **Administrative Efficiency**: Delivered through existing tax system

## Legislative Foundation

## Credit Structure

### Phase-In, Plateau, and Phase-Out

The EITC follows a trapezoid structure:
1. **Phase-In**: Credit increases with earned income
2. **Plateau**: Maximum credit maintained
3. **Phase-Out**: Credit decreases as income rises
