# Child Tax Credit (CTC)

## Overview

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) is a federal tax credit that helps families offset the cost of raising children. Originally enacted as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, the credit has undergone significant expansions and modifications, most notably through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

### Policy Objectives

1. **Reduce child poverty** through direct financial assistance to families
2. **Offset child-rearing costs** for middle-income families  
3. **Encourage labor force participation** through phase-in structure
4. **Provide horizontal equity** in the tax system by recognizing family size
5. **Support economic stability** for families with children

### Taxpayer Eligibility

- **Filing Status**: All statuses eligible except Married Filing Separately
- **Identification**: Taxpayer must have valid SSN or ITIN
- **Earned Income**: Required for refundable portion (minimum $2,500 for 2024)

## Credit Structure

### Maximum Credit Amounts (2024)

| Child Category | Maximum Credit | Refundable Portion |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Under age 17 with SSN | $2,000 | Up to $1,700 |
| Other dependents | $500 | $0 |

### Phase-Out Structure

The credit begins to phase out when modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) exceeds:

| Filing Status | Phase-Out Begins | Phase-Out Rate |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Married Filing Jointly | $400,000 | $50 per $1,000 of income |
| All Other Statuses | $200,000 | $50 per $1,000 of income |

### Refundability Rules

The Additional Child Tax Credit (refundable portion) equals the lesser of:
1. Unclaimed CTC amount, or
2. 15% × (earned income - $2,500), or
3. $1,700 per qualifying child (2024 amount, indexed for inflation)

## Benefit Calculation

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Step 1**: Determine number of qualifying children  
**Step 2**: Calculate tentative credit = Number of children × $2,000  
**Step 3**: Apply phase-out if MAGI exceeds threshold  
**Step 4**: Subtract credit from tax liability  
**Step 5**: Calculate refundable portion if credit exceeds tax liability  

### Example Calculations

#### Example 1: Middle-Income Family
- **Family**: Married couple, 2 qualifying children
- **MAGI**: $75,000
- **Tax liability**: $3,500

```
Tentative credit: 2 × $2,000 = $4,000
Phase-out: $0 (income below $400,000 threshold)
Nonrefundable credit: min($4,000, $3,500) = $3,500
Remaining credit: $4,000 - $3,500 = $500
Refundable credit: min($500, 15% × ($75,000 - $2,500)) = $500
Total benefit: $3,500 + $500 = $4,000
```

#### Example 2: High-Income Family
- **Family**: Single parent, 1 qualifying child
- **MAGI**: $240,000
- **Tax liability**: $45,000

```
Tentative credit: 1 × $2,000 = $2,000
Phase-out: (($240,000 - $200,000) ÷ $1,000) × $50 = $2,000
Final credit: $2,000 - $2,000 = $0
Total benefit: $0
```

## State Interactions

### State Child Tax Credits

Many states offer their own CTCs that interact with the federal credit:

| State | Credit Structure | Federal Interaction |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| California | Up to $1,117 per child | Independent of federal |
| Colorado | Varies by income | References federal eligibility |
| New York | $330 or 33% of federal | Calculated as percentage |
| Maryland | $500 per child | Uses federal qualifying child |

### SALT Deduction Considerations

The federal CTC can affect state tax calculations through:
- State taxable income adjustments
- State credit phase-outs based on federal AGI
- Interaction with state dependent exemptions

## Program Interactions

### Tax Credit Ordering

The CTC interacts with other credits in a specific order:
1. Foreign Tax Credit
2. Child and Dependent Care Credit
3. Education Credits
4. **Child Tax Credit** (nonrefundable portion)
5. Other nonrefundable credits
6. Additional Child Tax Credit (refundable)

### Benefit Program Impacts

The refundable CTC may affect eligibility for:
- **SNAP**: Counted as unearned income in some states
- **TANF**: May reduce benefits dollar-for-dollar
- **Housing Assistance**: Generally excluded from income
- **Medicaid**: Not counted for MAGI-based eligibility

## Recent Legislative Changes

### American Rescue Plan Act (2021)
- Increased credit to $3,600 (under 6) and $3,000 (6-17)
- Made fully refundable
- Removed earned income requirement
- Authorized advance monthly payments
- **Status**: Expired December 31, 2021

### Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act (2024)
- **Proposed**: Increase refundability to $1,800 (2023), $1,900 (2024), $2,000 (2025)
- **Status**: Passed House, pending in Senate

## Administrative Considerations

### Documentation Requirements
- Birth certificates or adoption papers
- School records
- Medical records
- Proof of residency

### Common Errors
1. Claiming children who don't meet age requirement
2. Both parents claiming same child
3. Missing or invalid SSNs
4. Incorrect income reporting for phase-out

### IRS Compliance
- Mathematical error authority for CTC
- Automated underreporter program matches
- Refund delays for EITC/ACTC returns (PATH Act)

## Economic Impact

### Poverty Reduction
- Pre-TCJA: Lifted 2.7 million people out of poverty (2017)
- ARPA expansion: Reduced child poverty by 46% (2021)
- Current law: Lifts approximately 3 million from poverty

### Distributional Effects
- 90% of families with children receive some benefit
- Average benefit: $2,400 per family (2022)
- Phase-out affects approximately 5% of families
