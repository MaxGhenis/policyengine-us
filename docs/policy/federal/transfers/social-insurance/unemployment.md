# Unemployment Insurance (UI)

## Overview

Unemployment Insurance provides temporary financial assistance to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and are actively seeking new employment. Established as part of the Social Security Act of 1935, UI operates as a joint federal-state program with significant state variation in benefits and eligibility.

### Policy Objectives

1. **Income replacement** during involuntary unemployment
2. **Economic stabilization** through automatic counter-cyclical spending
3. **Maintain consumer spending** during economic downturns
4. **Incentivize rapid reemployment** through limited duration
5. **Support job search** activities without immediate financial pressure

## Legislative Foundation

### Federal Framework
- **Original Authorization**: Social Security Act of 1935 (Title III, IX, XII)
- **Current Authority**: 26 USC Chapter 23 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act)
- **Federal Regulations**: 20 CFR Parts 601-650
- **Administrative Agency**: U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration

### State Authority
- States administer their own UI programs within federal guidelines
- State laws determine specific eligibility criteria, benefit amounts, and duration
- Must meet federal requirements to qualify for administrative funding

## Eligibility Requirements

### Monetary Eligibility

States use one of several methods to determine monetary eligibility:

1. **High Quarter Method**
   - Minimum earnings in highest quarter of base period
   - Total base period earnings (typically 1.5× high quarter)

2. **Multiple of Weekly Benefit Amount**
   - Base period earnings must equal specified multiple of WBA
   - Common requirement: 40× WBA

3. **Flat Minimum**
   - Fixed dollar amount in base period
   - Range: $1,000 to $5,000 depending on state

### Base Period Definition

**Standard Base Period**: First 4 of last 5 completed quarters
**Alternative Base Period**: Last 4 completed quarters (available in most states)

Example for claim filed in July 2024:
- Standard: April 2023 - March 2024
- Alternative: January 2024 - June 2024

### Non-Monetary Eligibility

1. **Separation Reason**
   - **Qualifying**: Lack of work, layoff, reduction in force
   - **Disqualifying**: Voluntary quit without good cause, misconduct, fraud
   - **State Variations**: "Good cause" definitions vary significantly

2. **Able and Available**
   - Physically and mentally able to work
   - Available for suitable work
   - No restrictions that substantially limit employment opportunities

3. **Work Search Requirements**
   - Varies by state: 0-5 job contacts per week
   - Must accept "suitable" employment
   - May include registration with state employment service

4. **Citizenship/Work Authorization**
   - Must be legally authorized to work in the United States
   - Satisfactory immigration status during base period and benefit period

## Benefit Calculation

### Weekly Benefit Amount (WBA)

States use various formulas:

1. **High Quarter Method**
   ```
   WBA = High Quarter Wages ÷ 26
   or
   WBA = High Quarter Wages × Replacement Rate (varies 1/20 to 1/26)
   ```

2. **Annual Wage Formula**
   ```
   WBA = Annual Wages × 0.0385 (example from some states)
   ```

3. **Multiple of Average Weekly Wage**
   ```
   WBA = 50% of Average Weekly Wage in covered employment
   ```

### Minimum and Maximum Benefits (2024 Examples)

| State | Min WBA | Max WBA | Max Duration | Max Total |
|-------|---------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Alabama | $45 | $325 | 26 weeks | $8,450 |
| California | $50 | $450 | 26 weeks | $11,700 |
| Massachusetts | $45 | $1,149 | 26 weeks | $29,874 |
| Mississippi | $30 | $235 | 26 weeks | $6,110 |

### Dependent Allowances
